            <p>Bauzer arose out of a need in the market for a <strong>trading desk</strong> where all <strong>bulk</strong> or <strong>wholesale</strong> buyers can instantly check the <strong>availability</strong> of bulk fuel products as well as purchase <strong>prices</strong> and product <strong>location</strong>. <br> <br> The Bauzer platform was <strong>piloted</strong> and tested over 26 months, during which time over <strong>150 million litres</strong> were sold and processed. With accounts at every <strong>major South African bank</strong> and clientele from all <strong>major transport groups</strong>, we guarantee a&nbsp;<strong>secure trading process </strong>and environment. By using the platform, the end-user <strong>buys direct</strong> from the source or importer, eliminating up to five <strong>middlemen</strong> sales agents. Customers are therefore assured of the <strong>best available price</strong> in the market.&nbsp; <br><br> Customers will also enjoy&nbsp;<strong>peace of mind</strong>&nbsp;concerning the <strong>security</strong> of their business and <strong>payments</strong> to the company.

            <p>Once you have <strong>registered</strong>, a <strong>transaction</strong> proceeds as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>You view the&nbsp;<strong>current deals on offer</strong>&nbsp;to check if the product is available at your preferred&nbsp;<strong>location and price</strong>.</li>
<li>You <strong>place an order</strong> for a&nbsp;<strong>specific volume</strong>&nbsp;of product at a particular <strong>collection point</strong> (minimum order volume is <strong>10&nbsp;000 litres</strong>).</li>
<li>You receive a&nbsp;<strong>pro-forma invoice</strong>&nbsp;from Bauzer, reflecting the&nbsp;<strong>value </strong>of the transaction.</li>
<li>You <strong>pay in full</strong>&nbsp;into the designated Bauzer bank account, using the&nbsp;<strong>reference number</strong> on the pro-forma invoice.</li>
<li>Bauzer supplies you with&nbsp;<strong>product uplift authorisation documents </strong>so that you or your designated <strong>transporter</strong> can uplift the product at the&nbsp;<strong>designated collection point</strong>.</li>
<li>Once the product is uplifted, Bauzer issues you with a&nbsp;<strong>final invoice</strong>&nbsp;based on the&nbsp;<strong>net quantity of volume</strong>&nbsp;uplifted at the <strong>collection point</strong>, as recorded on your Bill of Lading.</li>
<li>If your collected volume is <strong>less </strong>than ordered and paid for (i.e., under-upliftment) you can either request an <strong>EFT reimbursement</strong> for the amount or a <strong>credit</strong> against your next order. In the event of an <strong>over-upliftment, </strong>you will need to pay the outstanding amount.</li>
<li><strong>Over- and under-upliftments</strong> usually take between <strong>7 to 10 working days</strong> to process; the delay is a result of oil major <strong>processing</strong> and <strong>admin</strong> procedures.&nbsp;</li>

<li>Vehicles need to have a&nbsp;<strong>safe loading pass</strong>&nbsp;for that facility.</li>
